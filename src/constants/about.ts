export const ABOUT = `Hi! I'm Andrew, a Computer Science student at UWaterloo and Software Engineer Intern at Snowflake. In the past, I've also worked at IBM, TD Bank, and the University of Toronto.

For me, programming is all about building and fixing. I want to build things that are easy to use and address meaningful pain points that the people around me experience.

In my free time, I love to play tennis, lift weights, and dabble in UI/UX design. I'm always open to meeting new people, so if you're building something interesting or want to chat, please reach out!`;
