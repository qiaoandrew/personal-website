export const ABOUT = `Hi! I'm Andrew, a Computer Science student at UWaterloo and Software Engineer Intern at Snowflake. At Snowflake, I've worked on the company's design system, Notebooks, and Streamlit.

For me, programming is all about building and fixing. I want to make things that solve real problems and are delightful to use.

In my free time, I love to play tennis, lift weights, and dabble in UI/UX design. If you're building something interesting or want to chat, feel free to reach out!`;
